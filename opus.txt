Project Status

Returning to this project after some time away. My short term goal is to make this into an animated auto battler.

I'll play with animations and PixilArt things to see if I can get the hang of animations.

Fights will be "Gambit" oriented. SAP meets STS meets Pokemon. Units will have special abilities that trigger at certain times.

Interested in "Choosing a class/path" a lot.
